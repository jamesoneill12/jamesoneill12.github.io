Welcome!

I'm a Machine Learning Research Scientist who has a PhD in Machine Learning from the Computer Science Department in University of Liverpool.
My research interests include neural network compression (e.g pruning, knowledge distillation), efficient training schemse of large DNNs and 
representation learning in natural language processing and computer vision. I am currently applying such methods in the start-up world focusing on 
making LLM smaller while maintaining performance and regulatory compliance at DynamoFL. 

Before my PhD I worked at the [Insight Center for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) in Galway, Ireland, working 
on applying machine learning to the legal domain and independently working on transfer learning schemes. 

Throughout my PhD I have undertaken 4 internships: 
* Two internships at [Amazon Search](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/location/tokyo-area-japan) in Tokyo, Japan as an Applied Scientist. 
* An intersnhip at [USC-ISI](https://www.isi.edu) in the [ Machine INtelligence and Data Science (Minds)](https://minds.isi.edu/) group, working on a project named Limited With Limited Labels (LwLL)
* An intersnhip at [Huawei Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-ireland-research-center/?originalSubdomain=ie) in Ireland, working on compression techniques for mono-lingual and cross-lingual models. 

Outside of machine learning I spend my time enjoying and watching some sports (:mma:,:weightlifting:,:swimming:, :gaelic:), travelling and socializing with friends.
